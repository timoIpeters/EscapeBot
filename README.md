# EscapeBot

I made this game for the "Programmierpraktikum" module of the [FH-Wedel](https://www.fh-wedel.de/). It is a clone of the LightBot puzzle game developed with JavaFX.
If you want to play the game, you can execute the PP_Peters.jar (java -jar PP_Peters.jar). To be able to run the executable, JRE 11 or above needs to be installed on your machine.

There is also a full documentation of the game and my programming process available in the [PP_Peters_Dokumentation.pdf](PP_Peters_Dokumentation.pdf) (german version only).
